# Pytorch-Football-dataset
 This repository contains code for processing a football dataset that includes videos and corresponding JSON annotation files. The code creates a custom dataset class to handle the data in a structured way.
## Introduction

The Football Dataset Processing project aims to assist in the handling and analysis of football videos along with their corresponding annotations. The dataset class provided here enables you to easily access player information and jersey numbers for each frame in the videos.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- JSON
